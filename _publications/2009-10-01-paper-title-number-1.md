This paper introduces advanced convolutional neural network (CNN) techniques designed to improve multi-image embedding in image steganography. By leveraging deep learning, our approach achieves higher data hiding capacity while maintaining imperceptibility and robustness against detection. We propose a novel architecture that optimizes the embedding process, enabling the concealment of multiple images within a single cover image. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance in terms of payload capacity, visual quality, and security compared to existing steganography methods.
