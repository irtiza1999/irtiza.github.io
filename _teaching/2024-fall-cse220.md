Taught **CSE220 Data Structures** during Fall 2024 and Spring 2025. Delivered lectures and labs on elementary data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees) and algorithms (sorting, searching, tree traversal). Emphasized implementation in Java and algorithmic efficiency through hands-on lab sessions.

### Course Objectives
- Introduced circular arrays and their advantages over linear arrays.
- Covered construction and manipulation of linked lists, stacks, and queues.
- Taught recursion and its application in problem-solving.
- Discussed tree structures and related algorithms.

### Course Materials
- *Algorithms in Java* by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne, 4th Edition, Addison-Wesley.
- *Introduction to Algorithms* by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein, 3rd Edition, MIT Press.
- Lecture slides, lab handouts, and assignments provided via buX.
