Taught **CSE422 Artificial Intelligence** during Summer 2025 (present). Delivered lectures and labs on core AI concepts, including intelligent agents, search strategies, constraint satisfaction problems, probabilistic reasoning, and machine learning. Emphasized problem-solving strategies, algorithm analysis, and practical implementation in AI languages.

### Course Objectives
- Introduced concepts of AI, rationality, and intelligent agent structures.
- Analyzed search strategies for informed and uninformed problems, deterministic/stochastic games, and constraint satisfaction.
- Covered algorithms' complexity, optimality, and completeness.
- Taught probabilistic reasoning, logic models, and basic machine learning concepts.

### Course Materials
- *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach* by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig, 3rd Edition, Pearson Education.
- Lecture slides, assignments, and lab materials provided via BRAC University's buX platform.
