## Bio
I am an Adjunct Lecturer in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at BRAC University, Dhaka, Bangladesh, and an aspiring Ph.D. candidate. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from BRAC University and am pursuing a Master’s degree at the same institution (expected completion Jun 2026). Passionate about AI and security, I combine expertise in machine learning and full-stack development to drive innovative solutions.
